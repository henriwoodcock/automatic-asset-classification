# Key Takeways:
- Asset recognition proves high accuracy through the use of transfer learning.
- An experimental idea to allow algorithms to cluster assets themselves.

# Introduction
Asset management is becoming recognised as an increasingly more important part of business in all industry, not just engineering. This project aims to automate the task of labelling images of assets, this is done by introducing two methods, _Semi-Automatic Asset Classification_ and _Automatic Asset Classification_. Semi-Automatic Asset Classification applies modern best standards of image classification on labelled images on water assets, this provides a way to automate labelling images providing some whereas Automatic Asset Classification is an experimental idea in which an algorithm clusters images of assets. The result may not lead to assets being grouped together as currently labelled but could lead to more natural groupings of assets instead of just by how humans have labelled them.
