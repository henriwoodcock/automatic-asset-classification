# Semi-Automatic Asset Classification
Image classification and object identification with neural networks has been proven very effect and has many real life applications now from driver-less cars [1] to unbiased queueing at a bar [2].

Semi-Automatic Asset Classification aims to apply these world standards to real-world asset classification. This is done by training a neural network on a set of labelled images.

## Transfer Learning
Many models have been trained to reach world records (some of these taking weeks to train), this has led to the discovery of _transfer learning_. Transfer learning refers to applying a pretrainined neural network to a new problem, this means that with open source models image recognition modelling is accessible even when little computing power is available as models now just have to be tweaked to fit to the specific data supplied.
