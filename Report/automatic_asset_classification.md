# Automatic Asset Classification
One area of image research is called _image clustering_. This refers to finding natural groupings of unlabelled images. In this context this could lead to new classifications for assets or even help supply multiple classifications of assets such as the official name of an asset but also the material it is made of or the environment it is located. This can help modellers deteriorate assets accurately and correctly by finding more information about them without having to visit them.

This can also be used in the context where the asset owner does not have any labelled images.
