# Conclusion
A combination of semi-automatic and automatic asset classification could be the best approach. If provided a set of labelled data, future data can be automatically given the correct pre-existing label. On top of that unsupervised automatic asset classification can help find more labels to datasets and provide more information such as groupings found based on materials and locations.
